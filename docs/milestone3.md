Documentation:

The secret santa backend uses a postgres database. Documentation for the database
is provided in the /database directory of this repository, in the form of a
schema diagram (in schema.pdf), as well as (postgres) SQL scripts to create the
database and to insert demo data in the database.

Division of Labor:

I'm the only person on my team, and all one of us contributed equally to the project.
