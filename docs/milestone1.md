## Innovative Idea 
We will create secret santa organizer. The secret santa app allow people to create their own secret santa group. A person will create the group, then invite people to their group. The users within their group will be randomly assigned to be someones secret santa. This app will solve a few problems like keeping secret santa groups organized and randomly assigning the secret santa for each person. Our most important feature that will differentiate us from other secret santa apps will be our gift suggestion feature. The will suggest good gifts at the price point of the secret santa.  

Important Components - We will start with a minimalist UI. A group will be started by a host. The host will then invite more participants. We can give a feature to the host whether or not they would like other participants to be able to invite more participants. Once everyone is invited, the host can start the secret santa matching. Each person will be randomly assigned to be a secret santa for one person in the group. We'll see if we are able to allow edits to add or remove people once secret santas have been assigned.  
We will implement a gift suggestion feature. This will be our most crucial feature in order for our app to be used over others. The app will make good gift suggestion to the secret santa for their given price point. In addition to budget we will use the date the present has to be received by, possibly wishlists, items people liked in the past on the app, as well likes and dislikes of suggested items to give good recommendations for the gift.
